STABILITY AND REACTIVITY \\n\\nStability:\\n\\nStable under normal conditions of storage and use.\\n\\nHazardous reactions: \\n\\nPolymerization may occur at elevated temperature or in the presence of \\nincompatible materials. \\n\\nHazardous decomposition products: \\n\\nOxides of carbon. Aldehydes. Phenolics. Toxic fumes. Irritating vapors.  \\n\\nIncompatible materials: \\n\\nOxidizing agents. Acids. Bases. Amines. \\n\\nConditions to avoid: \\n\\nKeep away from heat, ignition sources and incompatible materials. Avoid \\ntemperatures above 149°C (300°F). Note:  Heating the epoxy resin in this \\nproduct above 148.9 °C (300 °F) in the presence of air may cause slow \\noxidative decomposition.  Above 260 °C  (500 °F) polymerization of the epoxy \\nresin may occur.  Aliphatic polyamines can produce exothermic reactions with \\nepoxy resins  which in large masses can cause runaway polymerization and \\ncharring of the reactants.  Fumes and vapors from these thermal and chemical \\ndecompositions vary widely in composition and toxicity.  Do not breathe \\nfumes. Take measures to prevent the build-up of electrostatic charges. \\n\\nIDH number: 701989\\n\\nProduct name: DB EPOXY Pot CMPD E-60NC 50 ML\\n\\nPage 3 of 5 \\n\\n\\x0c11.

FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES \\n\\nAutoignition temperature: \\n\\nNot available. \\n\\nFlammable/Explosive limits - lower: \\n\\nNot available.\\n\\nFlammable/Explosive limits - upper: \\n\\nNot available.\\n\\nExtinguishing media: \\n\\nFoam, dry chemical or carbon dioxide.  \\n\\nSpecial firefighting procedures: \\n\\nWear self-contained breathing apparatus and full protective clothing, such as \\nturn-out gear. \\n\\nUnusual fire or explosion hazards: \\n\\nIn case of fire, keep containers cool with water spray.  Closed containers may \\nrupture (due to build up of pressure) when exposed to extreme heat.   May \\ndecompose above 149°C (300°F). May polymerize above 260°C (500°F) in \\nwhich case closed containers may rupture or explode.   Fumes and vapors \\nfrom thermal decompositions vary in composition and toxicity. \\n\\nHazardous combustion products: \\n\\nOxides of carbon. Aldehydes. Phenolics. Toxic fumes. Irritating vapors.\\n\\n6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES \\n\\nUse personal protection recommended in Section 8, isolate the hazard area and deny entry to unnecessary and unprotected \\n\\npersonnel. \\n\\nEnvironmental precautions: \\n\\nDo not allow product to enter sewer or waterways. \\n\\nClean-up methods: \\n\\nHandling: \\n\\nStorage:\\n\\nRemove all sources of ignition. Ensure adequate ventilation. Wear appropriate \\npersonal protective equipment. Refer to Section 8 \"Exposure Controls / \\nPersonal Protection\" prior to clean up. Soak up with inert absorbent material \\n(e.g. sand, silica gel, acid binder, universal binder, sawdust). Scrape up spilled \\nmaterial and place in a closed container for disposal. \\n\\n7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE \\n\\nPrevent contact with eyes, skin and clothing.  Do not breathe vapor and mist.  \\nWash thoroughly after handling. Use only with adequate ventilation. Keep \\ncontainer closed. \\n\\nFor safe storage, store at or below 149 °C (300.2 °F) \\nStore in original container until ready to use. Keep container tightly closed and \\nin a cool, well-ventilated place away from incompatible materials. Keep away \\nfrom heat, spark and flame. \\n\\nFor information on product shelf life contact Henkel Customer Service at (800) 243-4874. \\n\\nIDH number: 701989\\n\\nProduct name: DB EPOXY Pot CMPD E-60NC 50 ML\\n\\nPage 2 of 5 \\n\\n\\x0c8.

STABILITY AND REACTIVITY \\n\\nStability:\\n\\nStable under normal conditions of storage and use.\\n\\nHazardous reactions: \\n\\nPolymerization may occur at elevated temperature or in the presence of \\nincompatible materials. \\n\\nHazardous decomposition products: \\n\\nOxides of carbon. Aldehydes. Phenolics. Toxic fumes. Irritating vapors.  \\n\\nIncompatible materials: \\n\\nOxidizing agents. Acids. Bases. Amines. \\n\\nConditions to avoid: \\n\\nKeep away from heat, ignition sources and incompatible materials. Avoid \\ntemperatures above 149°C (300°F). Note:  Heating the epoxy resin in this \\nproduct above 148.9 °C (300 °F) in the presence of air may cause slow \\noxidative decomposition.  Above 260 °C  (500 °F) polymerization of the epoxy \\nresin may occur.  Aliphatic polyamines can produce exothermic reactions with \\nepoxy resins  which in large masses can cause runaway polymerization and \\ncharring of the reactants.  Fumes and vapors from these thermal and chemical \\ndecompositions vary widely in composition and toxicity.  Do not breathe \\nfumes. Take measures to prevent the build-up of electrostatic charges. \\n\\nIDH number: 701989\\n\\nProduct name: DB EPOXY Pot CMPD E-60NC 50 ML\\n\\nPage 3 of 5 \\n\\n\\x0c11.

Closed containers may \\nrupture (due to build up of pressure) when exposed to extreme heat.   May \\ndecompose above 149°C (300°F). May polymerize above 260°C (500°F) in \\nwhich case closed containers may rupture or explode.   Fumes and vapors \\nfrom thermal decompositions vary in composition and toxicity. \\n\\nHazardous combustion products: \\n\\nOxides of carbon. Aldehydes. Phenolics. Toxic fumes. Irritating vapors.\\n\\n6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES \\n\\nUse personal protection recommended in Section 8, isolate the hazard area and deny entry to unnecessary and unprotected \\n\\npersonnel. \\n\\nEnvironmental precautions: \\n\\nDo not allow product to enter sewer or waterways. \\n\\nClean-up methods: \\n\\nHandling: \\n\\nStorage:\\n\\nRemove all sources of ignition. Ensure adequate ventilation. Wear appropriate \\npersonal protective equipment. Refer to Section 8 \"Exposure Controls / \\nPersonal Protection\" prior to clean up. Soak up with inert absorbent material \\n(e.g. sand, silica gel, acid binder, universal binder, sawdust). Scrape up spilled \\nmaterial and place in a closed container for disposal. \\n\\n7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE \\n\\nPrevent contact with eyes, skin and clothing.  Do not breathe vapor and mist.  \\nWash thoroughly after handling. Use only with adequate ventilation. Keep \\ncontainer closed. \\n\\nFor safe storage, store at or below 149 °C (300.2 °F) \\nStore in original container until ready to use. Keep container tightly closed and \\nin a cool, well-ventilated place away from incompatible materials. Keep away \\nfrom heat, spark and flame. \\n\\nFor information on product shelf life contact Henkel Customer Service at (800) 243-4874. \\n\\nIDH number: 701989\\n\\nProduct name: DB EPOXY Pot CMPD E-60NC 50 ML\\n\\nPage 2 of 5 \\n\\n\\x0c8.

STABILITY AND REACTIVITY \\n\\nStability:\\n\\nStable under normal conditions of storage and use.\\n\\nHazardous reactions: \\n\\nPolymerization may occur at elevated temperature or in the presence of \\nincompatible materials. \\n\\nHazardous decomposition products: \\n\\nOxides of carbon. Aldehydes. Phenolics. Toxic fumes. Irritating vapors.  \\n\\nIncompatible materials: \\n\\nOxidizing agents. Acids. Bases. Amines. \\n\\nConditions to avoid: \\n\\nKeep away from heat, ignition sources and incompatible materials. Avoid \\ntemperatures above 149°C (300°F). Note:  Heating the epoxy resin in this \\nproduct above 148.9 °C (300 °F) in the presence of air may cause slow \\noxidative decomposition.  Above 260 °C  (500 °F) polymerization of the epoxy \\nresin may occur.  Aliphatic polyamines can produce exothermic reactions with \\nepoxy resins  which in large masses can cause runaway polymerization and \\ncharring of the reactants.  Fumes and vapors from these thermal and chemical \\ndecompositions vary widely in composition and toxicity.  Do not breathe \\nfumes. Take measures to prevent the build-up of electrostatic charges. \\n\\nIDH number: 701989\\n\\nProduct name: DB EPOXY Pot CMPD E-60NC 50 ML\\n\\nPage 3 of 5 \\n\\n\\x0c11.
